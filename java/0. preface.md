# Learning Java
Java is the third language I decided to learn, following Python and JS. This part of the repo you may notice does not contain jupyter notebooks, and the reason for that is becasue I could not find a kernal that would let me run Java. All code that was written during the process of me learning java is held inside the `codeExamples` directory.
