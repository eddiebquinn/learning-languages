# Variables

## Variable declaration
Java is a statically typed language - In context what this means is that while languages like python allow you to make variables on the fly, with java variables need to be declared before they can be used. The following code would declare a variable called `firstNumber` with the type `int` and the value `2`.

```java
int firstNumber = 2;
```

It should be mentioned that after the `int firstNumber` the value itself is optional. 

You can also be mentioned that you can also declare the variable like this
```java
var subtraction = 7;
```
This practically does the same thing, the only diffrence it is that it doesnt explictly state that the variable is an `int`. If you are in the situation where the type of variable can be inferred from reading it, then you can use the `var` keyword. While this *can* be done, it is not best practise however. 

## Variable naming rules
In java in general you can name variables what you like, there are some rules however
- **Variable names can either start with a letter or an under score -** they *can* contain numbers but not as the first character
- **Variables must have the same name as a java keyword -** An example of a keyword is `class`. You *can* prefix the name with `$` if you need to, but it is not recommended
