# Structure of a Java program
Lets assume you have a "Hello World" program written in java

```java
package learningJava;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

were going to analyze it

## Use of brackets
- **{} -** Used to define code blocks
- **() -** Used in the declaration and calling of methods
- **[] -** Used in index

## The code itself
**`package learningJava`**
This states the package this code is part of

**`public class Main`**
This is declare on the first line, and what it is doing is declaring a class called `Main`. The closing brackes for this is declared on line 8, meaning everything inside the codelock between those two `{}`s is part of the `Main` class.

**`public static void main(String[] args)`**
This a method which is part of the wider `Main` class, however the method itself is declared with a small m rather than a capital m. It can seen that betewen the `{}`s that it contains a single line of code. As mentioned before `()`s are commonly used to call methods, however in this case they are used in the declaration of a methods. Simmilar to almost all languages, when declaring a new method you put arguments inside the `()` as can be seen here with `String[] args`. Here only one parameter is defined, that being `args`, and from the `String[]` and the fact it contains `[]` we can assertain that `args` is an array

**`System.out.println("Hello World!");`**
This a method call with the parameter `"Hello World!"`
