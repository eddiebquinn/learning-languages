# Learning Java
Java is the third language I decided to learn, following Python and JS. This part of the repo you may notice does not contain jupyter notebooks, and the reason for that is becasue I could not find a kernal that would let me run Java. All code that was written during the process of me learning java is held inside the `codeExamples` directory.

I would also like to say I will not be making notes on naming convetions and such, there are thousands of style guides written already and I can just refer to them in future if I have to. For ease of accsess the google style guide is linked [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
