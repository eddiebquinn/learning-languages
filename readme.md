# Learning Languages
This is a general-purpose repo that I made to store notes and sample codes of different languages I am learning. The repo won't include a file for python, because I made this repo after I already had the basics of that language understood. This is not for actual coding projects, those would either be found in [micro-projects](https://github.com/eddiebquinn/Micro-Projects) or have their own dedicated repo.                                                              

I would also like to note overall that these notes are not made for other people to learn from. Some coding concepts I already know and understand, and therefore do not feel the need to make additional notes on. These may *help* people to learn, but please do not complain if they seem nonsensical.
