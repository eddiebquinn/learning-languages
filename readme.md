# LaTeX
LaTeX is a document preparation system used for creating professional-looking documents such as academic papers, reports, and books. It is built on top of the TeX typesetting system, which provides high-quality typesetting algorithms that allow precise control over the layout of text and equations. LaTeX provides a range of features for formatting text, including the ability to use different fonts, adjust line spacing, and create tables and lists. It is particularly well-suited for producing technical documents that contain complex mathematical equations, which can be typeset with ease using LaTeX's built-in math mode. LaTeX documents are created using plain text files that can be easily edited using any text editor, and the resulting output can be generated in a variety of formats, including PDF, HTML, and PostScript.

I am fully aware that LaTeX is not traditionally considered a programming language - However I wanted to store this information in a repo, and this seemed the best fit
