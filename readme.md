# Learning Languages
This is a general-purpose repo that I made to store notes and sample codes of different languages I am learning. The repo won't include a file for python, because I made this repo after I already had the basics of that language understood. This is not for actual coding projects, those would either be found in [micro-projects](https://github.com/eddiebquinn/Micro-Projects) or have their dedicated repo.                                                              

Wherever possible the notes have been taken in a Jupyter notebook
